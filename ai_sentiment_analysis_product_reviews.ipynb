We tried the lesser expensive spring locks, but he can still open the drawers a little bit and climb up.  That's when I found the tot locks and the drawers do not budge unless you have the key.  I love the option where he can't pry the drawer open to climb.  Spring locks are good in our kitchen for easy frequent access, but for a bedroom tot locks are perfect!  I've read reviews where they are difficult to install, I had no issues at all with directions or install.\",\n          \"We bought this based on customer reviews. Thus far we like it very much and so does the little one. The size is just right. Not too big, but big enough to last a little longer than other similar products. Colors are nice. The four toys are great, especially if you are a cleanliness freak, like I am, because you can play with the baby touching the toys on the \\\"dirty\\\" outside of the crib. There are only 4 toys but each is perfect.\",\n          \"I did a lot of research before buying a \\\"diaper system\\\" (asked friends, read other reviews on amazon, consulted baby product guides, etc.).  There didn't seem to be a consensus on the best one out there.  However, I have been very happy with my Diaper Champ purchase - the stink is contained, the dirty diapers drop in easily and it uses regular kitchen bags (no special bags required like other systems).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5,\n          1,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Strollers & Car Seats\",\n          \"Diapers & Potty Training\",\n          \"Pacifiers\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ai_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Negative\",\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
